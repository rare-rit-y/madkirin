 #commonalty
 BAC_COC_m1: "Prepare The Foundation"
 BAC_COC_m1_desc: "Now that we have decided to skip the intermediate bridge like the Kingdom of Concord and immediately establish the Commonalty, we must act without any delay. The Committee for Preparation of the Foundation will be the starting point, and its composition must be unbiased if it is to truly realize the spirit that drew kirin to the uprising: "§8All creatures should be equal before Concord.§!""
 BAC_COC_h1: "Honour Our Friends"
 BAC_COC_h1_desc: "Our victory was ultimately due to the blood-soaked efforts and sincere friendship of our comrades-in-arms. It is of the utmost importance that their blood not be shed in vain, especially those ponies who believe in §7Princess Celestia§! and her teachings of true harmony, from the far far away. And... a few other creatures who believe in... some ideas."
 BAC_COC_c1: "The Voice Must Be Heard"
 BAC_COC_c1_desc: "Although we became victorious, there are countless kirin families who have been forced to give up their daily food for the desperate fight. Very now, their voices must be heard, because there is no kirin left who doesn't know how desperation and fury on the brink can §Rmanifest§! itself, in these darkest days after the Silence of Kiria."
 BAC_COC_m2: "Commonalty Constitutional Senate"
 BAC_COC_m2_desc: "While it is important to ensure freedom for common, it is also essential to keep pace with the modern world if we are not to be swept away helplessly by the tyrannical tide of heartless steel. The platform of a modern state is legal stability, and the first step in ensuring that is the constitution."
 BAC_COC_h2: "Adopt Equestrian Autunomy System"
 BAC_COC_h2_desc: "§7Equestria§! is ruled by alicorns - the immortal monarchs, but it's actually very decentralised. It would be a great idea to emphasise this fact and push for the system to be embraced and even enshrined in the constitution. And it's one that no one would argue against. There is a reason we follow Equestria, after all."
 BAC_start_phase_2_tt: "§gThis trait will be gained upon the foundation.§!"
 BAC_COC_c2: "Codify Empowerment Action" 
 BAC_COC_c2_desc: ""§tMass Empowerment Through Direct Action§!" (colloquially referred to as "§tempowerment actions§!") was a clever tactic we employed in the revolution against the Empire. It's also quite democratic. We need to build on this and constantly inspire the common so that we don't become another "§ODivine§! but corrupted" §OFire§!! Not by dumbing the common down."
 #BAC_COC_prop: "Our Cause Must Be Informed" 
 #BAC_COC_prop_desc: "There are still so many kirin in the rural Realm who don't know that we've won, and we need to make sure they know that, but we also need to make sure they know that we can speak for them, and we need to make sure their voices are heard further. That's why we do these hard works."
 BAC_COC_m3: "The Countdown!"
 BAC_COC_m3_desc: "Now that the most important parts of the Constitution are in place, We can't put off founding any longer, so let's take care of the most urgent things first, and then declare Commonalty."
 BAC_COC_h3: "Committee for Foreign Affairs"
 BAC_COC_h3_desc: "The harms of the Silence are so many, but this time it's our relations with the international society need to be addressed. We're in a serious diplomatic crisis now that we've overthrown the successor to the Realm - the Empire, considered a legitimate one. Let's start with the list of foreign dignitaries to be invited."
 BAC_COC_c3: "Land Investigation Programme" #토지조사사업
 BAC_COC_c3_desc: "The loudest cry coming from all over the country is for to guarantee their lands that have been expunged by NAKP. It's also the most dangerous one. If all these allegations are true, surely there's no reason not to do so. First, we need to clear right and wrong. So that land reform can be implemented according to local conditions. At the very least, a plan should be announced."
 
 BAC_COC_true_commonalty: "The Declaration!"
 BAC_COC_true_commonalty_desc: "Finally, the day has come! It's been a long, hard road since the uprising against the NAKP. There is still much work to be done, many gaps to be filled, and many unresolved disputes, but for today, let's celebrate our nation as one - along with the motto of the Common Senate, which was voted-on at the final session of the Committee for Preparation of the Foundation!"
 BAC_COC_true_commonalty_tt: "§g"Never to §Olead§!, always to §Phelp§!."§!"

 BAC_COC_pol_head: "Committee for Commonal Education"
 BAC_COC_pol_head_desc: "Due to the complexity inherent in kirin letters, the literacy rate is significantly higher compared to advanced nations. The CCE has been ordered to focus on this illiteracy issue according to the consensus of the Commonal Senate, yet progress is reportedly slow. The highly esteemed §PDayspring Rose§! will be appointed as a special chief commissioner to find out what problems are."
 BAC_COC_pol_h1: "Assertive Conversion"
 BAC_COC_pol_h1_desc: "The Way of Fire bears the responsibility for not having been of any assistance as Kiria transformed into a horrific battlefield. Who was it that forced the Silence in the first place? No matter how secluded or harmless those who worship this monstrosity may be, it's unacceptable to have such a flawed values. These values eat away at their innocent hearts until they turn into monsters like those."
 BAC_COC_pol_c1: "Allow The Way of Fire"
 BAC_COC_pol_c1_desc: "Despite the numerous misdeeds committed by the hideous monster known as The Way or Divine Fire, the Way of Fire still remains a glimmer of light in the hearts of the innocent folks and §g(perhaps even more naive)§! devout priestesses. Although they torn our Realm apart and reduced it to tatters, should we do the §Osame§! to the hearts of these faithful?"
 BAC_COC_pol_h2: "Purge The Extremist Conservatives"
 BAC_COC_pol_h2_desc: "We're not going to all this trouble to slaughter naive kirin, but it would be needed to prepare in case dialogue doesn't convince them at all... If they don't eventually accept the true gospel, aren't those §Oevil§!? In the very first place, they're the ones who didn't listen to the kirin crying out."
 BAC_COC_pol_c2: "Educate The Temple Schools" # 사원 학교 훈육
 BAC_COC_pol_c2_desc: "The most devout of The Way of Fire's clergy would spend their life's savings to build schools. The bloodsuckers in Sorghum before the Uprising were all evil, but why burn this beautiful tradition and its legacy to the ground now? With a few tweaks to suit realities for nowadays, it would be so much better, and it might even appease the Communion."
 BAC_COC_pol_m2: "Justice For Common" #
 BAC_COC_pol_m2_desc: "There is a cause for all of this, and there are somekirin who are responsible. But they have been unwilling to bear the weight of that responsibility, and it's time to make amends. A trial for the crimes of the NAKP and its henchmen would be a good start. Although it was concerned with the Committee on Judicial Affairs, number of exceptions will apply to this trial..."
 BAC_COC_pol_m2_ctt: "Has missed §Y$KIR_fickle_current$§! and his lackeys"
 BAC_COC_pol_h3: "Reorganise The Aureolin"
 BAC_COC_pol_h3_desc: "The Aureolin Monastery has stood as a stalwart bastion for the Way of Fire and its successor Divine Fire, even though it is located in the Western Territories which has been Rising Fire's domain for some time. Now that our religious authority is stronger than ever, we can seize it. It will be of use."
 BAC_COC_pol_c3: "Establish True Autunomy"
 BAC_COC_pol_c3_desc: "Residents should be able to control their own destiny, except for matters that inevitably need to be dealt with by the Common Senate. Creating norms that allow for maximum freedom but are better suited to masking shenanigans will help between residents within a region, between regions, and between regions and the Senate."
 
 BAC_COC_eco_head: "Committee For Industry And Development"
 BAC_COC_eco_head_desc: "Riding the wave of modernisation is important. But there's a danger in our impatience we'll repeat the mistakes or outright faults, of our predecessors. Luckily, we have Kindling Flash. His ad hoc yet artistic control of production has brought out qualities in him. And of course, he's all about the people, which should allay these concerns."
 BAC_COC_eco_h1: "Trinitarian Labor Collective"
 BAC_COC_eco_h1_desc: "Equestria is fantastic land where different pony subspecies work together to do amazing things and solve problems. The qualities that Her Radiant Trinity has bestowed upon us - upon kirin, are nothing short! We've just been slow to realise. There is nothing that a group of sisters and brothers in faith can't accomplish."
 BAC_COC_eco_h2: "Contact With Equestrian Ties"
 BAC_COC_eco_h2_desc: "We have many creatures from Equestria. We should focus on them and continue our connection to Equestria. ...Also some from elsewhere as well, but isn't it obvious that few would question the fact that Equestria is the most powerful nation in the world? At the very least, Equestria is far more prosperous than most of the socialist nations, at least."
 BAC_COC_eco_h3: "Yet Another Accord"
 BAC_COC_eco_h3_desc: "The Realm of Kiria was quite good terms with Equestria. But with the collapse of the Realm, the Hyacinth Accord - which was (or some would argue that) instrumental in the modernization of that country - was laid to rest. Now that we have been recognized by Equestria as the legitimate regime of Kiria, it would be of great benefit to us if we could enter into an equivalent terms."
 bac_verdant_accord_idea: "The Verdant Accord"
 #bac_verdant_accord_3_offmap_civ_facs: "$MODIFIER_INDUSTRIAL_FACTORY_DONATIONS$: §G£civ_factory  +5§!"
 BAC_COC_eco_h4: "Friendship is Magic!"
 BAC_COC_eco_h4_desc: "At last, in the name of Her Radiant Trinity, we have achieved the feats of modernisation and globalisation simultaneously! Kirin are free, our streets are filled with friendship and love, and the Commonalty has become the land of harmony! Now, as equal economic player, we will ensure that this monumental success is forever remembered by signing the Free Trade Agreement with the Equestrian Economic Bloc."
 BAC_COC_eco_c1: "Initiate Land Reform" #gives timed idea i think
 BAC_COC_eco_c1_desc: "The Communalists don't really care about all this talk of modernisation, because the only thing that matters is making sure that the kirin in this Realm don't go hungry. If we can follow the principle of 'Land to the Tiller' and give each farmer just enough land to ensure optimal production for themselves, there will be no more starving kirin."
 BAC_COC_eco_m2: "New Campaign Town" #새마을운동
 BAC_COC_eco_m2_desc: "When the NAKP brought modernization to this land for the first time in this century, they said that we, the ignorant kirin, could only compete by working for low wages, poor diets, and harsh conditions. The foolishest and most rebellious were the first to die. We must continue to prove the NAKP wrong, as our very existence proves. That is the only honor we can give to those who have gone before us."
 BAC_COC_eco_c2: "Grain Propagation Plan" #産米增殖計劃
 BAC_COC_eco_c2_desc: "Though reforming the land system and distributing land is the most important thing, but if there is no food in the stomachs of kirin, millions must starve. We need to put everything into farming this year. Because the fields - already devastated by the civil war - can't feed everykirin. Holding on for now, but it won't last long. The most urgent need is to improve irrigation, so let's get started."
 BAC_COC_eco_c2_tt: "§Y$BAC_famine_timed$§! National Spirit will be removed in 730 days.\n"
 BAC_famine_timed: "Famine Effort"
 BAC_COC_eco_m3c: "The Kirian Heritage"
 BAC_COC_eco_m3c_desc: "The heritage that the name Kiria has left us is mostly filth, the most valuable of which are only the resources that lie dormant under its ground. We have literally nothing to thank it for since a lot of sweat and tears will go into the process."
 BAC_COC_eco_m3h: "Let Them Run Through The Vein of Industry"
 BAC_COC_eco_m3h_desc: "If steel is the rice of industry, then oil is the blood of industry. Also if the modern armies in the heads of young generals are to become a reality, they need oil to run them of course."
 BAC_COC_eco_c3: "Conclusion of Land Reform"
 BAC_COC_eco_c3_desc: "Land is the lifeline of peasants, so this land reform alone took a lot of hard work and had a lot of twists and turns, but we can be glad that it's over now. Nokirin is begging and starving in the streets just because they don't own the land, even though it's arable land all around them. If only the people would recognize our hard work..."
 BAC_COC_eco_c4: "Justice! Democracy! Dignity!"
 BAC_COC_eco_c4_desc: "The unequal distribution of all things is becoming a thing of the past. The people have been given back what belongs to the people, and the land has been given back to the tillers. This is the result of everycrature coming together under the banner of Justice, Democracy, and Dignity. We will continue to move toward true equality!"
 BAC_COC_eco_m4h: "Plan Zebrica"
 BAC_COC_eco_m4h_desc: "Now that we have modernised the Commonalty, we need to further increase our naval power to ensure that our people's freedom is most assuredly protected at sea. Plan Zebrica will be the start."
 BAC_COC_eco_m4c: "Light Industry For Everykirin"
 BAC_COC_eco_m4c_desc: "We can't do what usual developmentalist dictatorships do: force sacrifices on the promise of increasing the pie, and then not care about anything at all. The fruits of modernization and development must be shared by all."
 BAC_COC_eco_m4m: "Electrify The Common" #만민에게 전력을
 BAC_COC_eco_m4m_desc: "A vast network of power lines shall connect the bustling metropolises to the farthest rural hamlet, the tendrils of modernity criss-crossing Commonalty to weave a web of Her Radiance and progress. The fervent spirit of innovation ignited, churned into being by the gears of industry, will leap and spark from pylon to towering pylon, breathing fire and vigor into the veins of the Commonalty." #KIR_focus_9g_desc
 BAC_COC_eco_m4m_tt: "Unlocks £decision_icon_small  §YElectrify§! decisions for each core state, taking this decision will upgrade its §YState Category§! and gives §Y$BAC_its_electric_state$§! State Modifier."
 BAC_COC_diplo: "Expand Foreign Affairs"
 BAC_COC_diplo_desc: "Putting on a face may not be enough. The international community is cold. We need to blend in if we don't want to be swayed by what they decide behind closed doors. The Committee for Foreign Affairs is currently a ragtag organization that was hastily thrown together on the eve of the foundation, so we need to start by revamping it."
 BAC_COC_diplo_tt: "Unlocks §Y$BAC_COC_embassy$§! £decision_icon_small Decisions, which allows us to establish §CCommonalty Embassies§! in the capital cities of §Gfriendly countries§!."
 BAC_COC_modern_science: "Committee for Science and Technology"
 BAC_COC_modern_science_desc: "We're reaching the point where we can't simply look at superficial aspects and copy them. The time has come for another standing committee to devise a more systematic approach."
 BAC_COC_applied_science: "Research and Development Complex"
 BAC_COC_applied_science_desc: "Our kirin scientific and technological capabilities now rival those of any other nation in the world! Now that we have achieved modernity, it is time to move forward to secure our future once again. A slight edge in technology will save hundreds of thousands of blood!"

 BAC_COC_mil_head: "Committee for Military Affairs"
 BAC_COC_mil_head_desc: "There are many steeds that have been rumoured to be the chief of the Committee for Military Affairs, but it is widely believed that some of the most active generals currently on the Senate will be among them. Delegate Ember Glow will soon be presenting a new motion to the Senate, and this current affairs gossip will soon be forgotten."
 BAC_COC_mil_head_tt: "Now the §Y$BAC_PaPA$§! modifier can be enhanced with related foci! Unlike others, each §7faction§!-§Rspecific§! military foci will weaken the §YPower§! for themselves."
 BAC_COC_mil_h1: "In Her Valiancy"
 BAC_COC_mil_h1_desc: "In the name of Her Radiant Trinity, we should be better able to draw on our own strength. Even in situations where close combat is not expected such as a battle on the plains, if we maintain a calm mind like Clean Mirror and Still Water, we can fight and win against superior enemies with inferior weapons."
 BAC_COC_mil_c1: "Let The Common Arms"
 BAC_COC_mil_c1_desc: "We're sick and tired of suicide raids, onhoof rushes against superiorly equipped opponents. In order to properly harness and maximise the power of the people, we need to prioritise the distribution of equipment that everycreature can easily learn to use, rather than cumbersome martial arts training."
 BAC_COC_mil_h2: "Bring Equestrians In"
 BAC_COC_mil_h2_desc: "Our armies have never had much luck with neither artilleries nor motors, however it has been said that Equestrian military-industry interests have sensed this gap and contacted us. Doesn't it sound like a beautiful friendship that will yield great results for both sides? Her Radiant Trinity shall be pleased."
 BAC_COC_mil_m2: "Manage The Ivory Pieces"
 BAC_COC_mil_m2_desc: "We can't win a war only with overwhelming motivation or high spirits alone - elaborate plans backed by careful intelligence-gathering and thorough examination are the key to victory. The most important thing to do this is to have training and discipline - two things this peasant army lacks..."
 BAC_COC_mil_c2: "Spread First-aid Training"
 BAC_COC_mil_c2_desc: "We are not meant to die pointlessly on the battlefield as bullet sponges. Everycreature can be somecreature's parent, sibling, child, friend, or lover. While it may not be feasible to equip every division with a field hospital, we must at least make an effort to reduce casualties. After all, a soldier becomes stronger for surviving."
 BAC_COC_mil_h3: "The Spearheads of Her Radiant Trinity"
 BAC_COC_mil_h3_desc: "To honor Her Radiant Trinity and Her will, we must be able to strike anywhere. Landing on the shore is one of the most difficult and arduous operations, but we kirin will do it, for we have accomplished a revolution that nocreature, not even ourselves, thought possible."
 BAC_COC_mil_m3h: "Militarised Labor Collective"
 BAC_COC_mil_m3h_desc: "There is no limit to the potential of what can be accomplished when the good kirin who serve Her Radiant Trinity come together, and we are pretty sure that we can accomplish even more with these siblings in faith. The harder they work, the harder the soldiers on the frontlines can fight."
 BAC_COC_mil_m3c: "Examine Provincial Mobilisation"
 BAC_COC_mil_m3c_desc: "It's been a long time since the uprising, and we still don't have a proper mobilization system in place. Why not make it democratic? There are still plenty of kirin who want to fight, so we shouldn't have a shortage of troops... at least not until these honest, kind kirin realize the sweetness of a free-ride..."
 BAC_COC_mil_c3: "Convenient Weapon"
 BAC_COC_mil_c3_desc: "Operating a howitzer requires the skilled crew, and precise trajectory calculations are necessary to ensure that the shot is not in vain. Not easy for us kirin, who were peasants and wage-laborers not so long ago. What if we had a weapon that could shoot directly instead?"
 BAC_COC_mil_h4: "Fight For Her Radiance"
 BAC_COC_mil_h4_desc: "We will fight not only in the muddy and dusty fields, dense forest, or rugged heights, but also at sea and in the air. Under the protection of Her Radiant Trinity, our enemies will not be able to stop our advance; it is our mission, the misson only ours, to bring them to Her Primordial Fire. Onward!"
 BAC_COC_mil_m4h: "Blessed Steel Steeds"
 BAC_COC_mil_m4h_desc: "These mighty steel steeds can serve as Her champions in this mortal world, and if we can better utilize them, we can spread Her Radiance more widely."
 BAC_COC_mil_m4m: "For Peace And Plenty, And Freedom!"
 BAC_COC_mil_m4m_desc: "We've come a long way since those humble peasant armies, and we can't afford to fail to defend the Commonalty. So long as there is peace and plenty- our peace and plenty, and freedom can only be defended by ourselves."
 BAC_COC_mil_m4c: "Dare-to-die Resistance"
 BAC_COC_mil_m4c_desc: "We fought for our survival. We fought for our freedom. We will fight to the death ironically to preserve our survival and freedom. It has been said that "those who seek death shall live, those who seek life shall die"; even though we die, we will fight as a free being."
 BAC_COC_mil_c4: "Ultimate Weapon"
 BAC_COC_mil_c4_desc: "What if we had a weapon that could annihilate our enemies once and for all, without the risk of facing them on the battlefield? If potential adversaries knew we had this weapon, they wouldn't dare go to war with us in the first place. And if they got it first, it would be even worse..."

 BAC_COC_mil_navy: "Beyond The Riverine Navy"
 BAC_COC_mil_navy_desc: "We fought on so many riverines of Mellifluve, and now that Kiria is unified and must look to the wider world, we can't even survive in our own waters. This situation must change. If we create a proper navy, backed by a proper realm, our sailors will no longer have to fear pirates."
 BAC_COC_mil_air: "Flying Commonkirin"
 BAC_COC_mil_air_desc: "In the modern era, the battlefield has become a place where the air element must be actively considered. Fortunately, we don't have to go through the same trials and tribulations that others did, if we study intently the countless examples of aerial battles that have been and are still being fought in Griffonia and Zebrica. If we seize the air superiority, we can reap greater accomplishments with less bloodshed in a one-sided attack from above."
 BAC_COC_mil_navalair: "Naval Air Corps"
 BAC_COC_mil_navalair_desc: "The idea of a platform that allows aircraft to launch from the sea is the latest doctrine to emerge, but battleships still rule the seas. But will it ever be? With air launched torpedoes already getting better and better, how many more layers of armor do we need to protect that biggy warships? Taking a page from Equestria's playbook, developing naval aviation is the future of our navy."

 BAC_COC_sekrit_war_committee: "Prepare For War"
 BAC_COC_sekrit_war_committee_desc: "Through divine sacrifice, heroic deeds, desperate resistance, and kirin blood - the NAKP has been defeated, but those who threaten the kirin, those who threaten the children of Her Radiant Trinity are everywhere. If we want peace, let us prepare for war."
 BAC_COC_sekrit_war_committee_tt: "Since we are already in a faction, whenever we §8leave their faction§!:"

 BAC_COC_war_zaikiria: "March To Old Marches"
 BAC_COC_war_zaikiria_desc: "Let the faithfuls save the poor kirin who have been alienated from Her Radiance by the great debacle of the Silence, emphasising that they are all children before Her Radiant Trinity. Kirin there are also already groaning under the mad nirik warlords, reactionary despots, and decadent pagans. Let the common know that turning a blind eye to them will only lead to further disaster." #
 BAC_COC_convert_zaikiria: "All Children of Her Radiant Trinity"
 BAC_COC_convert_zaikiria_desc: "We have learned the hard way what a false faith can do when combined with other evils, though it is not powerful on its own. And if we are to be better beings, we must not allow our brothers and sisters, our equals as children under Her Radiant Trinity, to maintain their poor lives unenlightened."
 BAC_COC_friend_zaikiria: "Everykirin Can Glitter"
 BAC_COC_friend_zaikiria_desc: "Their beliefs and traditions should not be torn down by us as oppressors; they have their own value. It is a sign of weakness and insanity to paroxysmally try to correct others just because they are a little different from us - it is tyranny as well. We didn't accept Her Radiant Trinity to become that tyrant."

 BAC_COC_war_taungpau: "End The Eternal Mandate"
 BAC_COC_war_taungpau_desc: "Although this land is not heavily populated by kirin, it is strategically important. Securing it would give us a major advantage in any future wars with our neighbours, and contrary to the Communion's wishes, local religious issues are only a side issue."
 BAC_COC_convert_taungpau: "Her Radiant Mandate"
 BAC_COC_convert_taungpau_desc: "Though they are a different race from us - kirin, they have embraced the Way of Fire and melded it with their own ways. If they have embraced the Way of Fire, surely they can embrace Her Radiant Trinity. We must help these pure beings to get to the right path before they become corrupted like the Divine Fire."
 BAC_COC_friend_taungpau: "Their Unique Way"
 BAC_COC_friend_taungpau_desc: "To impose the same way of life on those who live in peace in Monastic Commune and then become victims of our unjust aggressive war is tyranny and oppression in itself. Why impose a paranoid path on them when they are free to live their lives as different but equal beings, even though we have been wronged? It is we, not they, who must truly learn the right way."

 BAC_COC_war_deer: "Biggest Counterplayer"
 BAC_COC_war_deer_desc: "There's unfortunately not much we could do to justify war with Hindia, other than utilise the international socialist rhetoric that's in a tiny minority in the Common Senate, which means that if those deers are 'ideological comrades', we will have to extend an olive branch first..."
 BAC_COC_convert_deer: "Let Them Be Children Also"
 BAC_COC_convert_deer_desc: "They are a foreign race and a pagan people who have never had much to do with us, but of course, if they wish, they should be encouraged to embrace our faith. While they were divided between the Olenians and the Hindians, we grew in strength, and we were victorious as a result, aren't we? Her Radiant Trinity will surely bless them if they are converted to our true faith."
 BAC_COC_friend_deer: "Our Deer Comrades"
 BAC_COC_friend_deer_desc: "We have liberated these deer, not conquered them. They have had a hard time under reactionary oppressors and now deserve peace under a free and democratic regime. They'll need a little protection and attention until they can run a truly mature democracy... but it is our duty."

 BAC_COC_war_barbarian: "Attack on Barbarian Lands"
 BAC_COC_war_barbarian_desc: "The griffons and zebras beyond the Westren Territories have a history of raiding our lands. Does it make any difference even in the modern era?

  baccocc.1.t: "To Prepare The Foundation"
  baccocc.1.d: "The soon-to-be Commonalty, the Children of Concord, was initially a loose alliance between the Communion of Her Radiant Trinity led by Dayspring Rose and the All-Kiria Union of Workers and Peasants led by Kindling Flash. Even at the onset of the uprising, this bond was solidified by a mutual animosity against the existential threat posed by the National Association of Kirin Patriots. However, now that a complete victory over the NAKP has been achieved, this bond has become as insubstantial as a mirage.\n\nWhile there is a certain closeness between Kindling Flash and Dayspring Rose, yet the realities of politics demand attention to their respective supporters. The Committee for Preparation of the Foundation has invited as many kirin as possible to ensure no one is left behind Concord, resulting in a multitude of voices. However, the two most dominant voices are those represented by the Communion and the Union.\n\nUnfortunately, the current situation within the CPF is in deadlock, with members of the two factions in opposition, making consensus on key issues unattainable. Both sides are aware that pushing through decisions on the principle of majority rule, without it being an institutionally guaranteed decision-making mechanism, lacks a basis for enforcement and is unlikely to lead to proper progress. The possibility of nirik transformation also cannot be ignored.\n\nFrom the start, the CPF has been mired in a stalemate."

  baccocc.2.t: "A Militarymare in the Committee"
  baccocc.2.d: "Once loyal to Rising Fire, Ember Glow now found herself idly seated as one of these commissioners who have been elected by their supporters, in a corner of the meeting room within a building temporarily serving for soon-to-be Commonalty, as the headquarter of CPF. She have been elected by her soldiers - her comrades in arms. The grueling war with NAKP had finally come to an end, and though she wished to bask in the peace that followed, it was at the earnest request of the CPF that she found herself here. Having fought alongside the causes of Kindling Flash and Dayspring Rose, she had no intention of sounding a dissenting note. Instead, she merely planned to witness the unfolding of this new chapter in history with her own eyes...\n\n\"General Ember Glow, might I solicit your esteemed opinion on a matter that has proven exceedingly contentious and remains deadlocked?\" a kirin inquired. Though she had faced such queries more than a dozen times that day alone, preferring not to take sides between Kindling and Dayspring, she steadfastly refused all answers. Most attendees, heavily influenced by the obstinate bannerkirin like Firethorn, did the same.\n\n\"Well, as a militarymare, I prefer not to lean towards any side. Perhaps it would be better for you to directly persuade those who oppose you?\"\n\nYet, despite the ongoing stalemates, no consensus could be reached on the contentious issues at hoof. As days passed, marked by meaningless attendances at dawn and equivalently meaningless leavings at dusk, Ember Glow's thoughts began to shift."
  baccocc.2.a: ""I cannot continue like this."" 

  baccocc.3.t: "The Private Meeting"
  baccocc.3.d: "While pondering what to have for dinner, Coral River barely remembered that she had been invited by Ember Glow and was now hurriedly making the way to her residence. The sun had already set over the western clouds. Arriving with heavy breaths, Coral River noticed that there was another guest present.\n\n\"Late, aren't you, Coral. Such a flustered sight.\"\n\"Firethorn! I didn't expect to see you here. Ember, you, you called another mare besides me at this hour...\" Coral retorted at Ember.\n\n\"Hmph.\" Ember Glow snorted. \"Had you been on time, it would have been less late.\"\n\nAs soon as Coral took her seat, the dinner commenced. After that, while Coral was savoring the aroma of the tea in front of her, Firethorn opened the conversation again. \"So, Ember Glow, what's the main point? You didn't call us here just for a meal during these times, did you?\" \"Of course not,\" Ember replied.\n\n"In my suspicion, the CPF seems to be losing its direction. The pro-Equestria faction and the Trinity-Worshippers both in the Communion are so intoxicated with their beliefs that they've become blind, and the communalist of the Union are too narrow-sighted. Not to mention the Marksists, a few but dazzled by their own ideology."" 
  baccocc.3.a: ""And?" Firethorn's brows furrowed." 

  baccocc.4.t: "To Achieve The Foundation"
  baccocc.4.d: "Ember continued, "That's why we need to step in, at least before the Communion and the Union irreversibly split apart. We need to prioritize with a broad perspective and offer a compromise that both sides can accept. If we can't set this country right, it will fall to foreign invasion once again."\n\nFirethorn, whose expression had already hardened, stood up. "I will not partake in such a play. I am a bannerkirin. My duty is to protect the kirin so they can enjoy democracy, not to make myself mingling with them."\n\n"Please, Firethorn. Your help would be invaluable. I'm not asking to become a warlord. To become a mediator. We can't just sit here and let this victory paid for with the blood of so many kirin slip away." Ember's tone was almost pleading, but Firethorn was having none of it and left the place - with a more ferocious look on her face as she heard the last words.\n\n"..."\n\nEmber sighed. "What about you, Coral?"\n\nAfter rolling her eyes, Coral pondered for a moment before answering, "Seems like you have a point. At least in that we need a goal. So, what exactly are you planning to do?"\n\nA flush of excitement appeared on Ember's face. "You know, I have some ideas. First of all we need to actively appease both sides...""
  baccocc.4.a: "And so the night deepened for the two of them alone."

  baccocc.5.t: "Which Law Should We Use?"
  baccocc.5.d: "In configuring the Committee for Preparation of the Foundation, we have exerted a considerable amount of effort, yet there remains much to be desired. The most pressing issue is the constitution itself. In the process of modernizing Kiria, the constitution could be said to be the foundation of aspiring to be a rule-of-law country, to the extent that it has been translated once as 'the System of Realm' (國制). To regulate a population beyond a certain size, a legal stability defined order is the best means, and at the same time, it becomes the first step in gaining the strength to protect the commonkirin in line with modernization.\n\nThe problem lies in which legal system we adopt. It's crucial whether to transplant the legal system of Equestria as the Harmonists argue. On the other hoof, the Griffons' or the Riverland constitution is not a preferred proposal since it reminds of the Fickle Current and his NAKP. Adhering to Equestrian laws as preferred by the Harmonists could be more economical due to compatibility with the most widely used legal systems in the world and the abundance of referenceable precedents and cases. Of course, it's not without its somewhat pro-foreign elements, so the Harmonists might need to spend some of their influence to push this through. Alternatively, starting anew based on the grand principle held in high esteem by the Trinity-Worshipping, passed down from the old Rising Fire movement, could also be a method: All creatures should be equal before Concord."
  baccocc.5.a: "Importing Equestrian Constitution is the best way."
  baccocc.5.b: "All creatures should be equal before Concord. That's where we start." #kirin.20.c

  baccocc.6.t: "Matter of Regional Autonomy"
  baccocc.6.d: "The issue of regional autonomy was handled as simply as could be expected: there was, of course, already a consensus among the heroes of the revolution, but crucially, for the commonkirin, there was no reason to oppose it at all: the Harmonisers, not to mention the Communalists, were apparently content enough to adopt something akin to the decentralised model of Equestria they envisioned, so there was no need for the Dayspring Rose to step in. \n\nEven amongst the religious interests, the main tenet of the main denomination the Radiant Trinity was the equality of everykirin before the Concord, so the faithful who had accepted Dayspring Rose's doctrines had no reason to rebel. The Divine Fire - formerly the Way of Fire, which had been upheld as the theology that justified centralisation, was considered to be largely culpable for the Silence of Kiria, so it's safe to say that few kirin cared about their opinions at this point. Of course, most of them were either 'executed' or deemed traitors to the NAKP in the immediate aftermath of the uprising.\n\nAlso those most likely to dislike such a decentralised foundation were those who had actively defied the NAKP in the first place, and were now mere prisoners, awaiting trial in the near future."
  baccocc.6.a: "It's really nice to know that some things just work out."

  baccocc.7.t: "Matter of Empowerment Action"
  baccocc.7.d: "During the revolt, it was anticipated that nobody would oppose the very nature of Empowerment Action's impressive contributions, and actually that was. Although the exact implementation of such a practice varied from province to province, and was a phenomenon almost exclusively confined to small agrarian villages in the rural countryside that were usually governed by a landlord-official appointed by regional representatives of the former government.\n\nHowever, this did not mean there were no issues. The progress was halted due to the vehement opposition of the Communalists to several clauses. Just before the proposal, Ember Glow had personally met with their leader, Kindling Flash, and had reached an agreement on those clauses, but it seems that it did not mean he could silence the voices of the Communalists.\n\nThe contentious clause was about the extent of restrictions imposed on the Action. What if the intent of those taking Action was actually to overthrow the Commonalty or to suppress the freedom and equality of the kirin? Even if not, should they not be held accountable if it stemmed from ignorance and misunderstanding in the future? It was in this context that the clause was added, but already the Communalist delegates had started condemning the 'authoritarianism and ignorance of the central authorities that do not trust the local kirin,' and as this news spread quickly, fiery protests were organized outside.\n\nThe situation began to worsen when several enraged Communion delegates exclaimed, "Would you tolerate it even if the remnants of the NAKP were plotting a coup?" Already, some protesters had started depicting the leadership as "Military-Matriarch," "Crossdressed Fire," or "Poncy Chairkirin." Only Her Radiant Trinity knows how this dire situation will unfold..." 
  baccocc.7.a: "Tearful persuasion eventually had an effect!"
  baccocc.7.b: "Perhaps it would be better just to step back..." #weekly st -0.001

  baccocc.10.t: "Matter of Educational Model"
  baccocc.10.d: "Dayspring Rose's steps towards the meeting hall of the Committee for Commonal Education were heavy. Her mind was filled with the contents of the minutes from the CCE meetings held before her appointment. The thought that Committee's only concern should be how to teach the kirin to read and write well seemed now as outdated as the thoughts of nearly-hundred-year-old mystic of Divine Fire. Arriving at the entrance of the meeting room, she took a deep breath and used her kirin telekinesis to open the door.\n\n"What's the hell difference between you and the Way!?" The room was already in chaos, with kirin engaged in physical altercations. Some were already emitting a sinister aura, their fangs growing longer.\n\n"Everykirin stop! We fought together and won together; we shouldn't be fighting among ourselves now!"\n\nFortunately, Dayspring's earnest plea seemed to reach the members, and the commotion subsided. However, many members from the Communion faction sent meaningful glances. "Ah, Dayspring, we are pleased to see you. The issue is whether to centralize or decentralize the educational system. We also aim for the utmost freedom, yet allowing such freedom even for Divine Fire seems to be quite problematic. If they sneak in their treacherous teachings and the innocent kirin take their words at face value, what will happen then?"\n\n"That's mere an excuse! Who believes those kirin nowadays! You all just want to sit above us and dictate!" Dayspring's mind was once again cluttered. Thanks to the CCE minutes she had read in advance, she had no trouble understanding the situation fortunately. However, this was not merely an educational issue. It was a matter of choosing between moving towards an ideal decentralized Commonalty or opting for a compromise of centralization to ensure stable modernization. It was also her role to appease those who did not get their way, preventing them from turning into nirik." #

  baccocc.11.t: "The Trials of NAKP and Divine Fire"
  baccocc.11.d: "With the defeat of NAKP, most of its executives and collaborators were captured, while unfortunate somekirin lost their lives during this process of course. Nonetheless, the leadership soon to become the Common Senate forbade summary executions of prisoners, promising 'fair' trials, or informally  'deserved' trials. Following the establishment of the constitution, criminal trials against NAKP became possible.\n\nAlthough these trials should rightfully be conducted according to the criminal procedure law, the first trial was held under the law of Divine Fire - formerly the Way of Fire. This had three purposes: firstly, to show that NAKP and its collaborators in Divine Fire had repeatedly violated traditional laws; secondly, to incite anger over how much of their actions were within the bounds of legality; and thirdly, to demonstrate that many acts considered guilty under that law - such as failing to anoint themselves after passing under a sacred gate - were merely superficial rituals.\n\nDuring the process, charges against each defendant including abuses, child labor exploitation, industrial accident management, suppression of labor disputes, and various white-collar crimes, which stirred public anger, were dismissed without prejudice just because they were not specified in the Divine law books. These matters were not meant to be revealed in public trials but became known from the start due to the sensational nature of the case. Although members of Divine Fire had indeed violated many stipulated laws, there was no regulation to punish them for these reasons, and in the case of NAKP, they could not be punished too due to the guarantee of the Hierocracy.\n\nThen, trials according to current law began. The jury system was applied, and the charges that had been previously dismissed were enough to already enrage them. There was no dispute that the minimum sentence to be pronounced was the death penalty, and pre-modern punishments such as flogging (essentially torture), posthumous execution, and collective punishment were frequently mentioned. Of course, since these were not punishments prescribed by current law, even if they were to be carried out, they would merely be private sanctions. The only exception who could escape death was the Matriarch Superior."

  baccocc.12.t: "The Army Has A Past And A Future" #kirin.112.t (firethorn)
  baccocc.12.d: "Firethorn sat with her eyes closed. Closing her eyes, the vivid memories of that day - the last day of the Banner of the Scented Moonflower, the last memories of the bannerkirin who failed to save her own Banner - came back to her clearly. The Scented Moonflower was her kin, her everything. They were also finest of the Realm, a wild card up the Realm's sleeve that was not prepared for the Second Cacophony with the dream called Grand Gallop Onward - A wild card crushed ultimately. Sensing somekirin's presence, she opened her eyes and said, "What is this, Ember Glow?"\n\n"Did you wait long? What brings you here?" Ember Glow asked casually, pretending like she doesn't know anything. Firethorn glared at her.\n\n"The motion about the Chief Commissioner for Military Affairs. Why nominate me? Didn't I say last time? I won't get involved in politics." Hearing this, Ember Glow met Firethorn's gaze.\n\n"You did. Yet this isn't about getting involved in it like before. Rather protecting the military from it. That's why you're the right kirin for the job. For a single example, If the budget isn't passed on time in the Senate, not only will modernizing the army be out of the question, but even the soldiers' daily food will be gone." Firethorn kept staring at Ember. Having lost everything and joined the peasants' uprising, she was now spending empty days after her long-awaited revenge had been achieved. And this mare was making trouble? Moreover, mentioning soldiers (if untrained peasants count as soldiers) she had commanded who were still alive...\n\n"Oh! And take this with you since you're here. I was going to bring it to you anyway, so it worked out." Ember's magic opened the saddlebag and levitated out a neatly-folded military uniform in the Equestrian style, though it also had silk embroidery in fiery patterns that gave it an obviously kirin flair. Firethorn was still silent. "Mahogany Blaze asked a school friend to get this. What do you think?"\n\n"Hmph." Firethorn snorted.\n\nBut when she left, it was with that saddlebag."
  baccocc.12.a: "Watching her back, Ember Glow smiled mischievously."

  baccocc.13.t: "An Invitation"
  baccocc.13.d: ""What brings you this time, Firethorn?" were the words Ember Glow said as she stood up from her desk at the office upon seeing the face of the visitor. Usually, even if there was a matter to be attended to, the only coming and going would be through official documents and the kirin who delivered them, so a direct visit like this was quite rare.\n\n"As you know, there's been some personnel movement within our forces lately, and I've come to hear your opinion on the officers you've commanded directly. Would it be alright if I take some of your time?" Firethorn was wearing an Equestrian style uniform, different from the last time she visited. Ember Glow smiled. "Of course, please take a seat." Then, several officers' names were mentioned, and small talk followed.\n\n"Ah, yes. I was reminded of that dinner we were treated to during the CPF days. Happens that I've come into some fine liquor myself and would like to return the favor. Would you care to join me for dinner tonight?" Firethorn said with a very calm expression. To an outsider, it might seem like a very mundane conversation happening to take place, but Ember Glow understood the hidden meaning. It surely meant that she wanted to discuss something politically very sensitive in a setting where no eavesdropping ears were present.\n\n"I'd love to. Mind if I bring along General Coral River? She might enjoy it.""
  baccocc.13.a: "Naturally, Firethorn did not turn down."

  baccocc.14.t: "In Her Residence"
  baccocc.14.d: ""This time you've come a bit early," Firethorn said to the two kirin who entered her residence. "Anyways. Dinner will take a while to prepare, so in the meantime, we might as well do some chat." Upon hearing this, Ember Glow and Coral River exchanged glances. Regardless, Firethorn was heading to her study. They followed her.\n\nThe study was filled with various documents from previous battles, scriptures from ancient arts of war, and other records else, but what stood out the most was a map of Eastern Zebrica which featured Kiria and the neighboring lands in high detail. On top of it were all sorts of wooden sculptures placed haphazardly. "How did you think to save all these amidst such chaos?" Coral River asked. "Well, it might seem like a lot to you, but to me, it's barely a drop in the bucket compared to what was at my clan home." Firethorn looked sad for a moment, as if remembering that old times, then hid her expression and began organizing the pieces on the map.\n\n"Ironically thanks to the recent instability, sending in spies disguised as refugees wasn't too difficult. It allowed us to better understand the foreign situation. To cut to the chase, these forces will pose a significant threat to us. Starting with the deer up north..." Firethorn continued, showing various reports to them, backing up her claims. From the political situation of neighboring countries to simulated wars based on their potential military strength.\n\n"Of course, given the potential of our peasant armies, we wouldn't easily lose a defensive war, but if we can deal with them before they grow stronger, we could spill significantly less blood. Making the actual decisions will be up to you and the other kirin, but hopefully this will be helpful.""

  baccocc.15.t: "Trot As Usual"
  baccocc.15.d: "It had been a hectic time for Firethorn, but she never missed her walks to clear her complicated mind, even in the midst of the hustle and bustle. That day was no different as she strolled through the garden, escaping from her usual hectic responsibilities. However, this day was different. Before she could even sense anything, a voice came from a blind spot. "Matriarch-Commander of the Scented Moonflower, Firethorn. It is you, indeed."\n\n'What in the world is this, an assassin from the NAKP remnants? But such level of stealth? And they mentioned a name long gone, instead of those bourgeois' vulgar rhetorics.' Firethorn was quite startled. Yet, realizing that the stranger not emitting any murderous intent might have allowed such stealth, she regained her composure. "I am merely a kirin, do not utter that vanished name again. And, if you have come to talk, it would be polite to show yourself, wouldn’t it?"\n\n"Ah, of course. Let me do so. The name I once bore has become as irrelevant as yours. Firethorn, would you forgive my rudeness?" As the words ended, the stranger suddenly revealed himself. Despite the wear and roughness from the harsh times, it was a face Firethorn recognized. Although she had few opportunities to see this face in reality, most kirin in this land didn’t even have that chance, but she was not among the majority. Looking into the eyes of the stranger, proven as Ember Wane - formerly the commander of the Banner of the Covered Cage, Firethorn asked. "So, what brings you to such a secluded place?"\n\n"I have come to contribute to your cause, and even though this place may seem secluded, there are worse places in the Realm suffering in turmoil." Ember Wane replied. Firethorn frowned. "Those are pleasant words, but unlike the other generals and me, what were you doing at the most critical moment?""
  baccocc.15.a: "Ember Wane's face showed no sign of embarrassment."

  baccocc.16.t: "The Memorial"
  baccocc.16.d: ""Well, that's a valid point. But think about it, as 'Chief Commissioner', you must have thought how strangely foolish the Imperial Kirian Army's deployment was?" Firethorn began to recall a moment from her time leading the Peasant Army during the revolution. Thanks to an inexplicable shift in the IKA formation on that day, she and her soldiers could save their lives while surrounded and awaiting death. Ember Wane continued, "It wouldn’t have been so easy if it weren't for those scumbags forming a makeshift army. And for me, I needed to familiarize myself with military tactics to forge that order." \n\n"Then why appear only now?" Firethorn asked, coming out of her thoughts.\n\n"It was one thing to know that the NAKP was doing nothing but harm to the world, but it was another thing to know that a group of peasants opposing it had the will and capacity to stabilise the Realm." Ember Wane frowned as if reminiscing about old times. "But my thoughts have changed recently. A few days ago, a preacher-provocateur came to the small village where I was hiding and pleaded for dedication to the cause. The starving and ragged figure was nothing but a tiny colt. Yet, what should an adult with will and capacity like myself fear, hiding in the outskirts?" Firethorn reluctantly nodded in agreement.\n\n"Indeed, your existence has reassured me. Despite of you denying that vanished name, it still remains in the hearts of old ones like me. Even if you do not incorporate me into your 'committee', I will find and do what I can for the Realm. Today, I have come today only to see if you still possess the perspicaciousness you once had." Then Ember Wane turned and started walking away leisurely.\n\n"There is no need for doing so." Firethorn called out to his back. "Your dedication to this land is deserving of respect. You'll be able to wear clothes that fit again without having to figure out what you can do on your own. Of course, if you have taken an interest in military affairs, that would be welcome." Ember Wane stopped his move. "However, this place is no longer the Realm. Only the Commonalty remains.""

  baccocc.36.d: "Kindling Flash watched as the metal monster chugged into Sorghum. The newly-built Sorghum Grand Central Terminus was packed with kirin of all trots of life, jammed so close together that the regiment of bannerkirin brought on for security struggled to keep the crowd from pushing them onto the glistening steel tracks in the station. Nokirin wanted to miss the exciting event, and he couldn't deny that he found it all exciting as well. After all, there would only ever be one first train from Verdant to Sorghum, establishing the link between the Commonalty's capital and its gateway along the coast. This moment, mundane as it normally otherwise would have been, meant something fantastic for so many kirin, and for the prosperity of the Commonalty itself.\n\nWhen the train finally rolled into the station, everykirin present let out a cheer and stomped their hooves for the engineers at the controls. As the engineers were escorted out of the engine and feted with garlands, food, and rice wine, Kindling Flash serenely smiled out over the crowd. "With the completion of the Sorghum-Verdant Line, our Commonalty is once again a part of the outside world," he announced, to much hooting and hollering. "This marvel is the first fruit of what I sincerely hope will be a bountiful harvest between our Commonalty. Hoof in hoof, I hope that we will have many more development such as this one."\n\nThen, to the surprise and awe of the crowd assembled, Kindling Flash stepped forward with his comrades and boarded the train as engineers get in the train engine.

She was a freshman at the Commonal Institute of Technology in Sorghum and was returning to her hometown for the weekend. Even after the train reached its destination, she had to take a small boat along the famous river for quite a while longer. But it was worth it, for the reunion with her waiting family and lover.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Common Senate building in Sorghum, Ember Glow was engrossed in the paperwork that plagued her. From the day's major committee meeting minutes to new bills introduced to the Senate, and endless materials something else. It wasn't until her assistant interrupted her for the end of the workday that she remembered she had an important dinner engagement.\n\nIn a bustling restaurant that served both Hindian and Zaikirian cuisine, it was crowded with customers. A deer named Cherith Kattumaram was among them. He brought along his zebra and griffon colleagues, joking that he never imagined he could enjoy authentic Hindian food here - even though he haven't experienced a proper cuisine in Hindia, as a thrall.\n\nAt a lodging, Kindling Flash was observing as Mahogany Blaze, Bright Burn, and Dayspring Rose exchanged opinions about the Radiant Trinity theology. Meanwhile Coral River teased Ember Glow with a smile for being late. The restrained Firethorn simply savored a sip of tea beside them. The old Banner patterns decorated on Firethorn’s military uniform hung on the wall sparkled under the light.\n\nOn a bright hillside in the outskirts, next to an unnamed grave, a kirin with a visibly unhappy expression lay beside the burial mound, endlessly staring at the setting sun. The grave was well-maintained. Despite facing the sunset, the old Banner pattern on his water bottle attached to his saddlebag did not sparkle at all. Even after a long time since that day, no light had entered his heart, waiting for someone who is in the underground never to return."

Why shouldn't we just attack and kick you back into the sea?" Dayspring Rose was nauseated by not the presumptious changeling in front of her but also the depths of the NAKP's amorality.\n\n"The city is quite well fortified, and the price you would pay for it is great." Finicus Vesali nodded his head to her. "Also, Fragrance is not a city that is very welcoming to your Radiant Trinity, ma'am. It resents the Silence for what it cost it, and if you seize it, all you will have is a city that loathes you and which would rise up in revolt before long."\n\n"Do you believe we are not willing to do whatever it takes to save our homeland?" Dayspring Rose asked him lowly. Finicus gave her a small smile. "I would not be so derogatory to suggest that the Fragrancese would win such a fight, but there will be very little left of the city when you do put them down. Who benefits from that? [ROOT.GetNameDef] does not need more conflict, and for your understanding, MHI can provide what it does need; industrial and technological aid. We will keep Fragrance under control, make sure that the loans we gave are repaid, without you even really needing to be involved in the process. In return, you will gain all the aid that we can give you, reconstruction will be sped up, and [ROOT.GetNameDef] will not need to deal with another war, nor the rebuilding of a levelled city.""

  #madkirin.1.t: "The Lecture"
  #madkirin.1.d: "\"-Taking what is not one's own is called Theft (盜), and taking Life (生) and damaging Property (物) is called Robbery (賊).\"\n\nThe sun was high in the sky, and those rogues from NAKP, Divine Fire mystics, or mere bandits, were assembled in detention to listen to her lectures and be edified into true children of Concord.\n\n\"You, who roam day and night with sleeves rolled up and eyes glaring, shamelessly plunder, and the worst of you call money 'brother' and murder your own families to become generals, have no right to discuss ethics or morality. Moreover, you steal foods from locusts, clothes from silkworms, block bees and take their honey, and the cruelest of you pickle ant larvae by the name of Concord, what could be more brutal than you?\"\n\nThis time her gaze fell on Divine Fire mystics.\n\n\"You talk of Principle (理) and Nature (性), and frequently mention the Concord, but if we see it as the Celestial Call (召命), creatures and kirin are all part of the myriad of things. If we speak of the Benevolence (仁) with which Concord and creatures bring forth all things - equines, locusts, silkworms, bees, ants, and kirin are all nurtured by Concord and the earth; thus should not harm each other. Looking at the distinction between Good and Evil (善惡), openly plundering the homes of bees and ants would surely make one the Great Theft (巨盜) between Concord and creatures? And plundering the very foundation of locusts and silkworms, would that not make one the Arch-enemy (大賊) against Benevolent Morality (仁義) ?\"\n\nThen the rogues on the spot fell to their knees." #박지원, 호질(虎叱)
