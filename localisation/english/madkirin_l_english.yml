 madkirin.1.t: "The Lecture"
 madkirin.1.d: "\"-Taking what is not one's own is called Theft (盜), and taking Life (生) and damaging Property (物) is called Robbery (賊).\"\n\nThe sun was high in the sky, and those rogues of the NAKP, the Way of Fire mystics, or mere bandits, were assembled in detention to listen to her lectures and be edified into true children of Concord.\n\n\"You, who roam day and night with sleeves rolled up and eyes glaring, shamelessly plunder, and the worst of you call money 'brother' and murder your own families to become generals, have no right to discuss ethics or morality. Moreover, you steal foods from locusts, clothes from silkworms, block bees and take their honey, and the cruelest of you pickle ant larvae by the name of Concord, what could be more brutal than you?\"\n\nThis time her gaze fell on the Way of Fire mystics.\n\n\"You talk of Principle (理) and Nature (性), and frequently mention the Concord, but if we see it as the Celestial Call (召命), creatures and kirin are all part of the myriad of things. If we speak of the Benevolence (仁) with which Concord and creatures bring forth all things, equines, locusts, silkworms, bees, ants, and kirin are all nurtured by the earth and should not harm each other. Looking at the distinction between Good and Evil (善惡), openly plundering the homes of bees and ants would surely make one the Great Theft (巨盜) between Concord and creatures? And plundering the very foundation of locusts and silkworms, would that not make one the Arch-enemy (大賊) against Benevolent Morality (仁義) ?\"\n\nThen the rogues on the spot fell to their knees."
 madkirin.1.c: "Her lecture is even more 'heretic'."
