 BAC_COC_m1: "Prepare The Foundation"
 BAC_COC_m1_desc: "Now that we have decided to skip the intermediate bridge like the Kingdom of Concord and immediately establish the Commonalty, we must act without any delay. The Committee for Preparation of the Foundation will be the starting point, and its composition must be unbiased if it is to truly realize the spirit that drew kirin to the uprising: "§8All creatures should be equal before Concord.§!""
 BAC_COC_h1: "Honour Our Friends"
 BAC_COC_h1_desc: "Our victory was ultimately due to the blood-soaked efforts and sincere friendship of our comrades-in-arms. It is of the utmost importance that their blood not be shed in vain, especially those ponies who believe in §7Princess Celestia§! and her teachings of true harmony, from the far far away. And... a few other creatures who believe in... some ideas." #우리가  무적처럼 보였던 적을 이겨낼 수 있었던 것은 결국 함께 싸운 전우들의 피로 젖은 노력과 진실한 우정 덕분입니다. 그들의 피가 헛되지 않도록 하는 것이 가장 중요합니다. 특히 이역만리에서 온, 셀레스티아 공주님과 그분의 가르침인 조화를 믿는 포니들과... 그리고... 약간... 다른 사상...을 믿는 생물들도 말입니다.
 BAC_COC_c1: "The Voice Must Be Heard"
 BAC_COC_c1_desc: "Although we became victorious, there are countless kirin families who have been forced to give up their daily food for the desperate fight. Very now, their voices must be heard, because there is no kirin left who doesn't know how desperation and fury on the brink can §Rmanifest§! itself, in these darkest days after the Silence of Kiria." #절박한 싸움에 쓰일 군량을 위해 그 날의 식량을 양보해야만 했던 키린 가정은 수도 없이 많습니다. 이번에야말로 그들의 목소리가 반드시 들려야만 합니다. 벼랑 끝에 몰린 절망이 키리아에서 어떻게 표출되기 마련인지 모르는 키린이 이 어두운 침묵 이후의 나날인 현재로서는 아마 없을테니까요.
 BAC_COC_m2: "Commonalty Constitutional Senate"
 BAC_COC_m2_desc: "While it is important to ensure freedom for common, it is also essential to keep pace with the modern world if we are not to be swept away helplessly by the tyrannical tide of heartless steel. The platform of a modern state is legal stability, and the first step in ensuring that is the constitution." #만민의 자유를 보장하는 것은 중요하지만 우리가 폭압적인 강철의 물결에 힘없이 스러져가지 않게 되기 위해서는 현대 세계에 발맞추어 걸어가는 것이 필수적입니다. 바로 직전까지 치렀던 그 모든 국난을 통해 피로써 얻은 교훈이겠지요. 현대국가의 기반은 법적 안정성이고 그것을 보장하기 위한 첫걸음은 바로 헌법입니다.
 BAC_COC_h2: "Adopt Equestrian Autunomy System"
 BAC_COC_h2_desc: "§7Equestria§! is ruled by alicorns - the immortal monarchs, but it's actually very decentralised. It would be a great idea to emphasise this fact and push for the system to be embraced and even enshrined in the constitution. And it's one that no one would argue against. There is a reason we follow Equestria, after all." #이퀘스트리아는 불멸의 군주가 다스리는 알리콘정 국가이지만 실상은 대단히 분권화되어 있습니다. 이 사실을 강조하면서 그 제도를 적극적으로 받아들이며 심지어 헌법에까지 명시할 수 있도록 추진해보는 것은 정말 좋은 생각입니다. 아무렴 누구도 반대하지 않을 안건이니까요. 우리가 이퀘스트리아를 따르는 것에는 그만한 이유가 있습니다.
 BAC_start_phase_2_tt: "§gThis trait will be gained upon the foundation.§!"
 BAC_COC_c2: "Codify Empowerment Action" 
 BAC_COC_c2_desc: ""§tMass Empowerment Through Direct Action§!" (colloquially referred to as "§tempowerment actions§!") was a clever tactic we employed in the revolution against the Empire. It's also quite democratic. We need to build on this and constantly inspire the common so that we don't become another "§ODivine§! but corrupted" §OFire§!! Not by dumbing the common down." #'직접 행동을 통한 대중 자율권 부여'(구어체로 '자율권행동'이라고도 함)는 황국에 맞선 혁명에서 우리가 발휘하였던 기발한 전술이었습니다. 또한 상당히 민주적이라고도 할 수 있죠. 이를 토대로 우리가 또다른 '신성하지만 타락한' 불이 되지 않도록 대중들을 끊임없이 고무시켜야 합니다! 그들을 멍청하게 만드는 게 아니라요.
 #BAC_COC_prop: "Our Cause Must Be Informed" 
 #BAC_COC_prop_desc: "There are still so many kirin in the rural Realm who don't know that we've won, and we need to make sure they know that, but we also need to make sure they know that we can speak for them, and we need to make sure their voices are heard further. That's why we do these hard works." #Realm에는 아직도 우리가 승리했다는 사실을 모르는 시골 키린들이 많습니다. 그 사실을 알리는 것은 물론이고 우리가 그들을 대변해줄 수 있다는 사실 또한 알려야 합니다. 그리고 저들의 목소리가 더욱 대변될 수 있도록 해야 합니다. 그게 바로 우리가 이 고된 일들을 하는 이유입니다.
 BAC_COC_m3: "The Countdown!"
 BAC_COC_m3_desc: "Now that the most important parts of the Constitution are in place, We can't put off founding any longer, so let's take care of the most urgent things first, and then declare Commonalty." # 헌법의 가장 중요한 부분들이 얼추 갖추어졌으니 이제 더 이상 건국을 미룰 수는 없습니다. 가장 시급한 일들이 무엇일지만 마지막으로 알아보고 나서 곧바로 Commonalty를 선포하도록 합시다.
 BAC_COC_h3: "Committee for Foreign Affairs"
 BAC_COC_h3_desc: "The harms of the Silence are so many, but this time it's our relations with the international society need to be addressed. We're in a serious diplomatic crisis now that we've overthrown the successor to the Realm - the Empire, considered a legitimate one. Let's start with the list of foreign dignitaries to be invited." # The Silence의 해악은 수도 없이 많지만, 이번에 해결해야 할 것은 바로 국제사회와의 관계 문제입니다. 정통성 있는 정부로 간주되던 Realm of Kiria의 후신, 즉 Empire of Kiria을 우리가 무너뜨린 상황이니 우리는 현재 심각한 외교적 위기에 처해 있다고 해도 과언이 아닙니다. 건국 선포식에 초청할 외국 귀빈들의 목록부터 시작할 것입니다.
 BAC_COC_c3: "Land Investigation Programme" #토지조사사업
 BAC_COC_c3_desc: "The loudest cry coming from all over the country is for to guarantee their lands that have been expunged by NAKP. It's also the most dangerous one. If all these allegations are true, surely there's no reason not to do so. First, we need to clear right and wrong. So that land reform can be implemented according to local conditions. At the very least, a plan should be announced." # 전국에서 몰려온 농민들이 부르짖는 아우성 중 가장 큰 소리로 나오는 것은 NAKP에 의해 말소된 토지 소유권을 보장해달라는 것입니다. 가장 위험한 내용이기도 하군요. 물론 이 주장이 전부 사실이라면 그리 하지 않을 이유는 없겠죠. 먼저 시시비비를 가려야 합니다. 그래야 현지 사정에 맞게 토지개혁을 실시할 수 있습니다. 적어도 이에 대한 계획이라도 발표해야 합니다.
 
 BAC_COC_true_commonalty: "The Declaration!"
 BAC_COC_true_commonalty_desc: "Finally, the day has come! It's been a long, hard road since the uprising against the NAKP. There is still much work to be done, many gaps to be filled, and many unresolved disputes, but for today, let's celebrate our nation as one - along with the motto of the Common Senate, which was voted-on at the final session of the Committee for Preparation of the Foundation!" #드디어 이 날이 왔습니다! NAKP에 맞선 봉기 때부터 돌이켜보면 정말 멀고 힘든 길이었습니다. 아직 해야 할 일이 많고, 채워야 할 빈틈도 많으며, 해결되지 않은 분쟁도 많지만, 오늘만큼은 하나된 마음으로 건국을 축하합시다, 건국준비위원회의 마지막 표결을 통해 결정된 Common Senate의 모토와 함께요!
 BAC_COC_true_commonalty_tt: "§g"Never to §Olead§!, always to §Phelp§!."§!"

 BAC_COC_pol_head: "Committee for Commonal Education" #만민교육위원회
 BAC_COC_pol_head_desc: "Due to the complexity inherent in Kirin letters, the literacy rate is significantly higher compared to advanced nations. The CCE has been ordered to focus on this illiteracy issue according to the consensus of the Commonal Senate, yet progress is reportedly slow. The highly esteemed §PDayspring Rose§! will be appointed as a special chief commissioner to find out what problems are." #키린 문자 특유의 난해함으로 인해 키린 문맹률은 선진국들에 비해 월등히 높은 편입니다. 민회의 총의에 따라 만민교육위원회는 이러한 문맹 문제에 주력할 것을 하명받았으나 여전히 일의 진행이 지지부진하다고 합니다. 명망 높은 Dayspring Rose를 특별위원장으로 위촉해 어떤 문제가 벌어지고 있는지 알아내도록 할 필요가 있습니다.
 BAC_COC_pol_h1: "Assertive Conversion"
 BAC_COC_pol_h1_desc: "Divine Fire bears the responsibility for not having been of any assistance as Kiria transformed into a horrific battlefield. Who was it that forced the Silence in the first place? No matter how secluded or harmless those who worship this monstrosity may be, it's unacceptable to have such a flawed values. These values eat away at their innocent hearts until they turn into monsters like those." #신성한 불은 키리아가 참혹한 전쟁터로 변모하는 과정에서 아무런 도움이 되지 않았다는 책임이 있습니다. 애초에 침묵을 강요한 것이 누구였던가요? 이 흉물을 숭배하는 자들이 아무리 벽지에 쳐박혀 있고, 아무리 무해하다 하더라도, 저것 같이 그들의 마음 속에 파고들어 괴물이 될 때까지 그 순수한 마음을 좀먹는 잘못된 가치관이 심어져 있어서는 안 됩니다.
 BAC_COC_pol_c1: "Allow The Way of Fire"
 BAC_COC_pol_c1_desc: "Despite the numerous misdeeds committed by the hideous monster known as Divine Fire, the Way of Fire still remains a glimmer of light in the hearts of the innocent folks and §g(perhaps even more naive)§! devout priestesses. Although they torn our Realm apart and reduced it to tatters, should we do the §Osame§! to the hearts of these faithful?" #신성한 불이라는 추악한 괴물이 저질렀던 실정은 적지 않지만, 그럼에도 시골의 순박한 주민들과 (어쩌면 그들보다 더 순박할) 독실한 사제들의 마음 속에는 불의 길이 여전히 한 줄기 빛으로 남아 있습니다. 그 신앙이 우리의 Realm을 찢어발기고 누더기로 만들었지만, 우리가 그 신실한 이들의 마음 속까지 그렇게 만들어야 할까요?
 BAC_COC_pol_h2: "Purge The Extremist Conservatives" # 수구 세력 숙청
 BAC_COC_pol_h2_desc: "We're not going to all this trouble to slaughter naive kirin, but it would be needed to prepare in case dialogue doesn't convince them at all... If they don't eventually accept the true gospel, aren't those §Oevil§!? In the very first place, they're the ones who didn't listen to the kirin crying out." # 우리는 순진한 키린들을 도륙하려고 이 고생을 하는 것이 아닙니다. 하지만 대화로 설득이 전혀 되지 않을 경우에는 대비할 필요가 있겠습니다... 결국 진정한 복음을 끝내 받아들이지 않는 자들은 모두 악한 것이 아니겠습니까? 애초에 기린들의 절규와 애환에 귀를 기울이지 않은 것도 저들입니다.
 BAC_COC_pol_c2: "Educate The Temple Schools" # 사원 학교 훈육
 BAC_COC_pol_c2_desc: "The most devout of The Way of Fire's clergy would spend their life's savings to build schools. The bloodsuckers in  Sorghum before the Uprising were all evil, but why burn this beautiful tradition and its legacy to the ground now? With a few tweaks to suit realities for nowadays, it would be so much better, and it might even appease the Communion." # 불의 길 승려들 중에서도 가장 독실한 이들은 일생의 가산을 털어 학교를 세우곤 했습니다. 봉기 이전에 Sorghum의 고혈을 빨던 자들은 모두 사악한 족속들이었지만, 이제 와서 이 아름다운 전통과 그 유산들을 불태워버릴 필요가 있을까요? 단지 오늘날의 실정에 맞게 약간의 보완만 가해진다면 훨씬 좋을 것이며 이를 토대로 Communion 쪽도 달랠 수 있을 것입니다.
 BAC_COC_pol_m2: "Justice For Common" #
 BAC_COC_pol_m2_desc: "There is a cause for all of this, and there are somekirin who are responsible. But they have been unwilling to bear the weight of that responsibility, and it's time to make amends. A trial for the crimes of the NAKP and its henchmen would be a good start. Although it was concerned with the Committee on Judicial Affairs, number of exceptions will apply to this trial..." # 이 모든 참사에는 원인이 있으며 그에 책임이 있는 키린들도 있습니다. 하지만 그들은 그간 그 책임의 무게를 짊어지려 하지 않았지요. 이제 바로잡아야 할 때입니다. NAKP와 그 부역자들의 죄에 대한 재판은 좋은 시작이 될 것입니다. 비록 법무위원회의 소관이긴 하지만, 이 재판에는 여러 예외가 적용될 것입니다...
 BAC_COC_pol_m2_ctt: "Has missed §Y$KIR_fickle_current$§! and his lackeys"
 BAC_COC_pol_h3: "Reorganise The Aureolin"
 BAC_COC_pol_h3_desc: "The Aureolin Monastery has stood as a stalwart bastion for the Way of Fire and its successor Divine Fire, even though it is located in the Western Territories which has been Rising Fire's domain for some time. Now that our religious authority is stronger than ever, we can seize it. It will be of use." # Aureolin Monastery는 한동안 Rising Fire의 세력권이었던 Westren Territories에 위치해 있었음에도 그간 Way of Fire와 그 후신인 Divine Fire를 위해 굳건한 보루로서 서있었습니다. 이제 우리의 종교적 권위가 그 어느 때보다 강력해진 지금 이것을 확보할 수 있게 되었습니다. 쓸모가 있을 것입니다.
 BAC_COC_pol_c3: "Establish True Autunomy" # 진정한 지방자치제도의 정착 coring
 BAC_COC_pol_c3_desc: "Residents should be able to control their own destiny, except for matters that inevitably need to be dealt with by the Common Senate. Creating norms that allow for maximum freedom but are better suited to masking shenanigans will help between residents within a region, between regions, and between regions and the Senate." # 주민들은 스스로의 운명을 스스로 정할 수 있어야 합니다. 어쩔 수 없이 Common Senate에서 다루어야 할 사안을 제외하면요. 주민들의 자유를 최대한 보장하되 시시비비를 가리기에 더욱 적합한 규범을 만들면 지역 내 주민들 사이에서도, 지역 사이에서도, 지역과 Senate 사이에서도 도움이 될 것입니다.
 
 BAC_COC_eco_head: "Committee For Industry And Development" #산업개발위원회
 BAC_COC_eco_head_desc: "Riding the wave of modernisation is important. But there's a danger in our impatience we'll repeat the mistakes or outright faults, of our predecessors. Luckily, we have Kindling Flash. His ad hoc yet artistic control of production has brought out qualities in him. And of course, he's all about the people, which should allay these concerns." # 현대화의 물결에 발맞춰서 따라가는 것은 중요합니다. 하지만 조급한 마음에 지나치게 서둘렀다간 전임자들의 실수, 또는 명백한 과실을 답습하게 될 우려가 있지요. 다행히도 우리에겐 Kindling Flash가 있습니다. 일전에 그가 선보였던 임시방편식이지만 예술적이었던 생산 통제는 스스로도 몰랐을 그의 자질을 드러내게 되었는데, 물론 그는 인민을 중요시하기 때문에 앞서 언급한 우려도 불식시킬 수 있을 것입니다.
 BAC_COC_eco_h1: "Trinitarian Labor Collective"
 BAC_COC_eco_h1_desc: "Equestria is fantastic land where different pony subspecies work together to do amazing things and solve problems. The qualities that Her Radiant Trinity has bestowed upon us - upon kirin, are nothing short! We've just been slow to realise. There is nothing that a group of sisters and brothers in faith can't accomplish." #이퀘스트리아는 서로 다른 포니 아종들이 서로 힘을 합쳐 놀라운 일들을 해내고 문제를 해결하는 환상적인 나라입니다. Her Radiant Trinity께서 우리 키린들에게 내려주신 자질은 결코 이에 못지 않습니다! 그저 우리가 이 사실을 뒤늦게나마 깨달았을 뿐입니다. 믿음의 형제자매들이 뭉치면 해내지 못할 일은 없습니다.
 BAC_COC_eco_h2: "Contact With Equestrian Ties"
 BAC_COC_eco_h2_desc: "We have many creatures from Equestria. We should focus on them and continue our connection to Equestria. ...Also some from elsewhere as well, but isn't it obvious that few would question the fact that Equestria is the most powerful nation in the world? At the very least, Equestria is far more prosperous than most of the socialist nations, at least." #우리에겐 이퀘스트리아에서 온 생물들도 많습니다. 이들을 중심으로 이퀘스트리아와의 연결을 이어나가야 합니다. 물론 다른 곳에서 온 생물들도 많기는 하지만, 이퀘스트리아가 세계 최강대국이라는 사실에 의문을 표할 이는 그리 없을 것이 명백하지 않습니까? 적어도 사회주의 국가들보다는 훨씬 번영한 나라입니다.
 BAC_COC_eco_h3: "Yet Another Accord"
 BAC_COC_eco_h3_desc: "The Realm of Kiria was quite good terms with Equestria. But with the collapse of the Realm, the Hyacinth Accord - which was (or some would argue that) instrumental in the modernization of that country - was laid to rest. Now that we have been recognized by Equestria as the legitimate regime of Kiria, it would be of great benefit to us if we could enter into an equivalent terms." #Realm of Kiria는 이퀘스트리아와 그리 소원한 사이가 아니었습니다. 하지만 그것의 멸망과 함께, 그 나라의 현대화에 큰 도움이 되었던(혹은 그랬으리라 혹자가 주장하는) Hyacinth Accord는 휴지조각이 되었습니다. 이제 우리가 Kiria의 적법한 정권임을 이퀘스트리아로부터도 인정받았으니 그에 준하는 조약을 체결할 수 있다면 우리에게 큰 도움이 될 것입니다.

 BAC_COC_eco_h4_desc: "At last, in the name of Her Radiant Trinity, we have achieved the feats of modernisation and globalisation simultaneously! Kirin are free, our streets are filled with friendship and love, and the Commonalty has become the land of harmony! Now, as equal economic player, we will ensure that this monumental success is forever remembered by signing the Free Trade Agreement with the Equestrian Economic Bloc." #마침내 우리가 Her Radiant Trinity의 이름으로 현대화와 세계화라는 위업을 동시에 이루었습니다! 키린들은 자유롭고, 거리에는 우정과 사랑이 넘쳐나며, Commonalty는 조화의 나라가 되었습니다! 이제 우리는 대등한 경제주체로서 이퀘스트리아 경제블록과의 자유무역협정 체결을 통해 이 기념비적인 성공이 영원히 상기되도록 할 것입니다.
 BAC_COC_eco_c1: "Initiate Land Reform" #gives timed idea i think
 BAC_COC_eco_c1_desc: "The Communalists don't really care about all this talk of modernisation, because the only thing that matters is making sure that the kirin in this Realm don't go hungry. If we can follow the principle of 'Land to the Tiller' and give each farmer just enough land to ensure optimal production for themselves, there will be no more starving kirin." #Communalists들은 현대화니 뭐니 하는 이야기에 그다지 관심이 없습니다. 중요한 것은 이 Realm에 사는 키린들이 배곯지 않도록 하는 것 말고는 없으니까요. 경자유전의 원칙에 따라 각 농가에 스스로 최적생산량을 보장할 수 있을만큼의 토지를 분배하게 될 수만 있다면 더 이상 굶주리는 키린이 없게 될 것입니다.
 BAC_COC_eco_m2: "New Campaign Town" #새마을운동
 BAC_COC_eco_m2_desc: "When the NAKP brought modernization to this land for the first time in this century, they said that we, the ignorant kirin, could only compete by working for low wages, poor diets, and harsh conditions. The foolishest and most rebellious were the first to die. We must continue to prove the NAKP wrong, as our very existence proves. That is the only honor we can give to those who have gone before us." #NAKP가 금세기 처음으로 이 땅에 현대화를 가져다주면서 말하기를, 무지몽매한 우리 키린들은 적은 임금과 빈곤한 식단, 열악한 환경에서 일해야만 경쟁력을 갖출 수 있다 하였습니다. 가장 어리석었던 이들과 가장 반항적이었던 이들은 가장 먼저 죽었습니다. 우리는 우리의 존재가 증명하듯 NAKP가 틀렸다는 사실을 계속해서 증명해야 합니다. 그것이 먼저 떠난 이들에게 갖출 수 있는 예우입니다.
 BAC_COC_eco_c2: "Grain Propagation Plan" #産米增殖計劃
 BAC_COC_eco_c2_desc: "Though reforming the land system and distributing land is the most important thing, but if there is no food in the stomachs of kirin, millions must starve. We need to put everything into farming this year. Because the fields - already devastated by the civil war - can't feed everykirin. Holding on for now, but it won't last long. The most urgent need is to improve irrigation, so let's get started." #토지제도의 개혁과 토지의 분배가 가장 중요한 일이긴 하지만, 정작 키린들의 뱃속에 들어갈 음식이 없다면 모두 굶게 될 것입니다. 올해 농사에 모든 것을 걸어야 합니다. 내전으로 이미 황폐해진 들판이 모든 키린들을 먹여살릴 수는 없을테니까요. 당장은 어떻게든 버티고 있지만, 오래 가지 못할 것입니다. 가장 급한 것은 관개시설의 정비입니다. 곧바로 시작합시다.

 BAC_COC_eco_c3_desc: "Land is the lifeline of peasants, so this land reform alone took a lot of hard work and had a lot of twists and turns, but we can be glad that it's over now. Nokirin is begging and starving in the streets just because they don't own the land, even though it's arable land all around them. If only the people would recognize our hard work..." # 토지는 농민의 목숨줄이라, 이 토지의 개혁 하나만으로도 엄청난 노고를 들여야 했고 우여곡절도 참 많았습니다. 하지만 이제 이렇게 토지개혁이 일단락되었으니 다행스러운 일입니다. 사방에 널린 것이 경작지인데도 소유권이 없어 길에서 구걸하며 굶주리는 키린은 이제 없습니다. 우리의 노고를 인민이 알아준다면 좋으련만...

Even at the onset of the uprising, this bond was solidified by a mutual animosity against the existential threat posed by the National Association of Kirin Patriots. However, now that a complete victory over the NAKP has been achieved, this bond has become as insubstantial as a mirage.\n\nWhile there is a certain closeness between Kindling Flash and Dayspring Rose, yet the realities of politics demand attention to their respective supporters. The Committee for Preparation of the Foundation has invited as many kirin as possible to ensure no one is left behind Concord, resulting in a multitude of voices. However, the two most dominant voices are those represented by the Communion and the Union.\n\nUnfortunately, the current situation within the CPF is in deadlock, with members of the two factions in opposition, making consensus on key issues unattainable. Both sides are aware that pushing through decisions on the principle of majority rule, without it being an institutionally guaranteed decision-making mechanism, lacks a basis for enforcement and is unlikely to lead to proper progress.

The grueling war with NAKP had finally come to an end, and though she wished to bask in the peace that followed, it was at the earnest request of the CPF that she found herself here. Having fought alongside the causes of Kindling Flash and Dayspring Rose, she had no intention of sounding a dissenting note. Instead, she merely planned to witness the unfolding of this new chapter in history with her own eyes...\n\n\"General Ember Glow, might I solicit your esteemed opinion on a matter that has proven exceedingly contentious and remains deadlocked?\" a kirin inquired. Though she had faced such queries more than a dozen times that day alone, preferring not to take sides between Kindling and Dayspring, she steadfastly refused all answers. Most attendees, heavily influenced by the obstinate bannerkirin like Firethorn, did the same.\n\n\"Well, as a militarymare, I prefer not to lean towards any side. Perhaps it would be better for you to directly persuade those who oppose you?\"\n\nYet, despite the ongoing stalemates, no consensus could be reached on the contentious issues at hoof. As days passed, marked by meaningless attendances at dawn and equivalently meaningless leavings at dusk, Ember Glow's thoughts began to shift."
  baccocc.2.a: ""I cannot continue like this."" 

  baccocc.3.t: "The Private Meeting"
  baccocc.3.d: "While pondering what to have for dinner, Coral River barely remembered that she had been invited by Ember Glow and was now hurriedly making the way to her residence. The sun had already set over the western clouds. Arriving with heavy breaths, Coral River noticed that there was another guest present.\n\n\"Late, aren't you, Coral. Such a flustered sight.\"\n\"Firethorn! I didn't expect to see you here. To think she called another mare besides me at this hour...\" Coral retorted at Ember.\n\n\"Hmph.\" Ember Glow snorted. \"Had you been on time, it would have been less late.\"\n\nAs soon as Coral took her seat, the dinner commenced. After that, while Coral was savoring the aroma of the tea in front of her, Firethorn opened the conversation again. \"So, Ember Glow, what's the main point? You didn't call us here just for a meal during these times, did you?\" \"Of course not,\" Ember replied.\n\n"In my suspicion, the CPF seems to be losing its direction. The pro-Equestria faction and the Trinity-Worshippers both in the Communion are so intoxicated with their beliefs that they've become blind, and the communalist of the Union are too narrow-sighted. Not to mention the Marksists, a few but dazzled by their own ideology."" 
  baccocc.3.a: ""And?" Firethorn's brows furrowed." 

  baccocc.4.t: "To Achieve The Foundation"
  baccocc.4.d: "Ember continued, "That's why we need to step in, at least before the Communion and the Union irreversibly split apart. We need to prioritize with a broad perspective and offer a compromise that both sides can accept. If we can't set this country right, it will fall to foreign invasion once again."\n\nFirethorn, whose expression had already hardened, stood up. "I will not partake in such a play. I am a bannerkirin. My duty is to protect the kirin so they can enjoy democracy, not to make myself mingling with them."\n\n"Please, Firethorn. Your help would be invaluable. I'm not asking to become a warlord. To become a mediator. We can't just sit here and let this victory paid for with the blood of so many kirin slip away." Ember's tone was almost pleading, but Firethorn was having none of it and left the place - with a more ferocious look on her face as she heard the last words.\n\n"..."\n\nEmber sighed. "What about you, Coral?"\n\nAfter rolling her eyes, Coral pondered for a moment before answering, "Seems like you have a point. At least in that we need a goal. So, what exactly are you planning to do?"\n\nA flush of excitement appeared on Ember's face. "You know, I have some ideas. First of all we need to actively appease both sides...""
  baccocc.4.a: "And so the night deepened for the two of them alone."

  baccocc.5.t: "Which Law Should We Use?"
  baccocc.5.d: "In configuring the Committee for Preparation of the Foundation, we have exerted a considerable amount of effort, yet there remains much to be desired. The most pressing issue is the constitution itself. In the process of modernizing Kiria, the constitution could be said to be the foundation of aspiring to be a rule-of-law country, to the extent that it has been translated once as 'the System of Realm' (國制). To regulate a population beyond a certain size, a legal stability defined order is the best means, and at the same time, it becomes the first step in gaining the strength to protect the commonkirin in line with modernization.\n\nThe problem lies in which legal system we adopt. It's crucial whether to transplant the legal system of Equestria as the Harmonists argue. On the other hoof, the Griffons' or the Riverland constitution is not a preferred proposal since it reminds of the Fickle Current and his NAKP. Adhering to Equestrian laws as preferred by the Harmonists could be more economical due to compatibility with the most widely used legal systems in the world and the abundance of referenceable precedents and cases. Of course, it's not without its somewhat pro-foreign elements, so the Harmonists might need to spend some of their influence to push this through. Alternatively, starting anew based on the grand principle held in high esteem by the Trinity-Worshipping, passed down from the old Rising Fire movement, could also be a method: All creatures should be equal before Concord."
  baccocc.5.a: "Importing Equestrian Constitution is the best way."
  baccocc.5.b: "All creatures should be equal before Concord. That's where we start." #kirin.20.c

  baccocc.6.t: "Matter of Regional Autonomy"
  baccocc.6.d: "The issue of regional autonomy was handled as simply as could be expected: there was, of course, already a consensus among the heroes of the revolution, but crucially, for the commonkirin, there was no reason to oppose it at all: the Harmonisers, not to mention the Communalists, were apparently content enough to adopt something akin to the decentralised model of Equestria they envisioned, so there was no need for the Dayspring Rose to step in. \n\nEven amongst the religious interests, the main tenet of the main denomination the Radiant Trinity was the equality of everykirin before the Concord, so the faithful who had accepted Dayspring Rose's doctrines had no reason to rebel. The Divine Fire - formerly the Way of Fire, which had been upheld as the theology that justified centralisation, was considered to be largely culpable for the Silence of Kiria, so it's safe to say that few kirin cared about their opinions at this point. Of course, most of them were either 'executed' or deemed traitors to the NAKP in the immediate aftermath of the uprising.\n\nAlso those most likely to dislike such a decentralised foundation were those who had actively defied the NAKP in the first place, and were now mere prisoners, awaiting trial in the near future."
  baccocc.6.a: "It's really nice to know that some things just work out."

  baccocc.7.t: "Matter of Empowerment Action"
  baccocc.7.d: "During the revolt, it was anticipated that nobody would oppose the very nature of Empowerment Action's impressive contributions, and actually that was. Although the exact implementation of such a practice varied from province to province, and was a phenomenon almost exclusively confined to small agrarian villages in the rural countryside that were usually governed by a landlord-official appointed by regional representatives of the former government.\n\nHowever, this did not mean there were no issues. The progress was halted due to the vehement opposition of the Communalists to several clauses. Just before the proposal, Ember Glow had personally met with their leader, Kindling Flash, and had reached an agreement on those clauses, but it seems that it did not mean he could silence the voices of the Communalists.\n\nThe contentious clause was about the extent of restrictions imposed on the Action. What if the intent of those taking Action was actually to overthrow the Commonalty or to suppress the freedom and equality of the kirin? Even if not, should they not be held accountable if it stemmed from ignorance and misunderstanding in the future? It was in this context that the clause was added, but already the Communalist delegates had started condemning the 'authoritarianism and ignorance of the central authorities that do not trust the local kirin,' and as this news spread quickly, fiery protests were organized outside.\n\nThe situation began to worsen when several enraged Communion delegates exclaimed, "Would you tolerate it even if the remnants of the NAKP were plotting a coup?" Already, some protesters had started depicting the leadership as "Military-Matriarch," "Crossdressed Fire," or "Poncy Chairkirin." Only Her Radiant Trinity knows how this dire situation will unfold..." 
  baccocc.7.a: "Tearful persuasion eventually had an effect!"
  baccocc.7.b: "Perhaps it would be better just to step back..." #weekly st -0.001

  baccocc.10.t: "Matter of Educational Model"
  baccocc.10.d: "Dayspring Rose's steps towards the meeting hall of the Committee for Commonal Education were heavy. Her mind was filled with the contents of the minutes from the CCE meetings held before her appointment. The thought that Committee's only concern should be how to teach the kirin to read and write well seemed now as outdated as the thoughts of nearly-hundred-year-old mystic of Divine Fire. Arriving at the entrance of the meeting room, she took a deep breath and used her kirin telekinesis to open the door.\n\n"What's the hell difference between you and the Way!?" The room was already in chaos, with kirin engaged in physical altercations. Some were already emitting a sinister aura, their fangs growing longer.\n\n"Everykirin stop! We fought together and won together; we shouldn't be fighting among ourselves now!"\n\nFortunately, Dayspring's earnest plea seemed to reach the members, and the commotion subsided. However, many members from the Communion faction sent meaningful glances. "Ah, Dayspring, we are pleased to see you. The issue is whether to centralize or decentralize the educational system. We also aim for the utmost freedom, yet allowing such freedom even for Divine Fire seems to be quite problematic. If they sneak in their treacherous teachings and the innocent kirin take their words at face value, what will happen then?"\n\n"That's mere an excuse! Who believes those kirin nowadays! You all just want to sit above us and dictate!" Dayspring's mind was once again cluttered. Thanks to the CCE minutes she had read in advance, she had no trouble understanding the situation fortunately. However, this was not merely an educational issue. It was a matter of choosing between moving towards an ideal decentralized Commonalty or opting for a compromise of centralization to ensure stable modernization. It was also her role to appease those who did not get their way, preventing them from turning into nirik." #

  baccocc.11.t: "The Trials of NAKP and Divine Fire"
  baccocc.11.d: "With the defeat of NAKP, most of its executives and collaborators were captured, while unfortunate somekirin lost their lives during this process of course. Nonetheless, the leadership soon to become the Common Senate forbade summary executions of prisoners, promising 'fair' trials, or informally  'deserved' trials. Following the establishment of the constitution, criminal trials against NAKP became possible.\n\nAlthough these trials should rightfully be conducted according to the criminal procedure law, the first trial was held under the law of Divine Fire - formerly the Way of Fire. This had three purposes: firstly, to show that NAKP and its collaborators in Divine Fire had repeatedly violated traditional laws; secondly, to incite anger over how much of their actions were within the bounds of legality; and thirdly, to demonstrate that many acts considered guilty under that law - such as failing to anoint themselves after passing under a sacred gate - were merely superficial rituals.\n\nDuring the process, charges against each defendant including abuses, child labor exploitation, industrial accident management, suppression of labor disputes, and various white-collar crimes, which stirred public anger, were dismissed without prejudice just because they were not specified in the Divine law books. These matters were not meant to be revealed in public trials but became known from the start due to the sensational nature of the case. Although members of Divine Fire had indeed violated many stipulated laws, there was no regulation to punish them for these reasons, and in the case of NAKP, they could not be punished too due to the guarantee of the Hierocracy.\n\nThen, trials according to current law began. The jury system was applied, and the charges that had been previously dismissed were enough to already enrage them. There was no dispute that the minimum sentence to be pronounced was the death penalty, and pre-modern punishments such as flogging (essentially torture), posthumous execution, and collective punishment were frequently mentioned. Of course, since these were not punishments prescribed by current law, even if they were to be carried out, they would merely be private sanctions. The only exception who could escape death was the Matriarch Superior."

  baccocc.12.t: "The Army Has A Past And A Future" #kirin.112.t (firethorn)
  baccocc.12.d: "Firethorn sat with her eyes closed. Closing her eyes, the vivid memories of that day - the last day of the Banner of the Scented Moonflower, the last memories of the bannerkirin who failed to save her own Banner - came back to her clearly. The Scented Moonflower was her kin, her everything. They were also finest of the Realm, a wild card up the Realm's sleeve that was not prepared for the Second Cacophony with the dream called Grand Gallop Onward - A wild card crushed ultimately. Sensing somekirin's presence, she opened her eyes and said, "What is this, Ember Glow?"\n\n"Did you wait long? What brings you here?" Ember Glow asked casually, pretending like she doesn't know anything. Firethorn glared at her.\n\n"The motion about the Chief Commissioner for Military Affairs. Why nominate me? Didn't I say last time? I won't get involved in politics." Hearing this, Ember Glow met Firethorn's gaze.\n\n"You did. Yet this isn't about getting involved in it like before. Rather protecting the military from it. That's why you're the right kirin for the job. For a single example, If the budget isn't passed on time in the Senate, not only will modernizing the army be out of the question, but even the soldiers' daily food will be gone." Firethorn kept staring at Ember. Having lost everything and joined the peasants' uprising, she was now spending empty days after her long-awaited revenge had been achieved. And this mare was making trouble? Moreover, mentioning soldiers she had commanded who were still alive...\n\n"Oh! And take this with you since you're here. I was going to bring it to you anyway, so it worked out." Ember's magic opened the saddlebag and levitated out a neatly-folded military uniform in the Equestrian style, though it also had silk embroidery in fiery patterns that gave it an obviously kirin flair. Firethorn was still silent. "Mahogany Blaze asked a school friend to get this. What do you think?"\n\n"Hmph." Firethorn snorted.\n\nBut when she left, it was with that saddlebag."
  baccocc.12.a: "Watching her back, Ember Glow smiled mischievously."

  baccocc.13.t: "An Invitation"
  baccocc.13.d: ""What brings you this time, Firethorn?" were the words Ember Glow said as she stood up from her desk at the office upon seeing the face of the visitor. Usually, even if there was a matter to be attended to, the only coming and going would be through official documents and the kirin who delivered them, so a direct visit like this was quite rare.\n\n"As you know, there's been some personnel movement within our forces lately, and I've come to hear your opinion on the officers you've commanded directly. Would it be alright if I take some of your time?" Firethorn was wearing an Equestrian style uniform, different from the last time she visited. Ember Glow smiled. "Of course, please take a seat." Then, several officers' names were mentioned, and small talk followed.\n\n"Ah, yes. I was reminded of that dinner we were treated to during the CPF days. Happens that I've come into some fine liquor myself and would like to return the favor. Would you care to join me for dinner tonight?" Firethorn said with a very calm expression. To an outsider, it might seem like a very mundane conversation happening to take place, but Ember Glow understood the hidden meaning. It surely meant that she wanted to discuss something politically very sensitive in a setting where no eavesdropping ears were present.\n\n"I'd love to. Mind if I bring along General Coral River? She might enjoy it.""
  baccocc.13.a: "Naturally, Firethorn did not turn down."

  baccocc.14.t: "In Her Residence"
  baccocc.14.d: ""This time you've come a bit early," Firethorn said to the two kirin who entered her residence. "Anyways. Dinner will take a while to prepare, so in the meantime, we might as well do some chat." Upon hearing this, Ember Glow and Coral River exchanged glances. Regardless, Firethorn was heading to her study. They followed her.\n\nThe study was filled with various documents from previous battles, scriptures from ancient arts of war, and other records else, but what stood out the most was a map of Eastern Zebrica which featured Kiria and the neighboring lands in high detail. On top of it were all sorts of wooden sculptures placed haphazardly. "How did you think to save all these amidst such chaos?" Coral River asked. "Well, it might seem like a lot to you, but to me, it's barely a drop in the bucket compared to what was at my clan home." Firethorn looked sad for a moment, as if remembering that old times, then hid her expression and began organizing the pieces on the map.\n\n"Ironically thanks to the recent instability, sending in spies disguised as refugees wasn't too difficult. It allowed us to better understand the foreign situation. To cut to the chase, these forces will pose a significant threat to us. Starting with the deer up north..." Firethorn continued, showing various reports to them, backing up her claims. From the political situation of neighboring countries to simulated wars based on their potential military strength.\n\n"Of course, given the potential of our peasant armies, we wouldn't easily lose a defensive war, but if we can deal with them before they grow stronger, we could spill significantly less blood. Making the actual decisions will be up to you and the other kirin, but hopefully this will be helpful.""

  baccocc.15.t: "Yet Another Trot"
  baccocc.15.d: "It had been a hectic time for Firethorn, but she never missed her walks to clear her complicated mind, even in the midst of the hustle and bustle. That day was no different as she strolled through the garden, escaping from her usual hectic responsibilities. However, this day was different. Before she could even sense anything, a voice came from a blind spot. "Matriarch-Commander of the Scented Moonflower, Firethorn. It is you, indeed."\n\n'What in the world is this, an assassin from the NAKP remnants? But such level of stealth? And they mentioned a name long gone, instead of those bourgeois' vulgar rhetorics.' Firethorn was quite startled. Yet, realizing that the stranger not emitting any murderous intent might have allowed such stealth, she regained her composure. "I am merely a kirin, do not utter that vanished name again. And, if you have come to talk, it would be polite to show yourself, wouldn’t it?"\n\n"Ah, of course. Let me do so. The name I once bore has become as irrelevant as yours. Firethorn, would you forgive my rudeness?" As the words ended, the stranger suddenly revealed himself. Despite the wear and roughness from the harsh times, it was a face Firethorn recognized. Although she had few opportunities to see this face in reality, most kirin in this land didn’t even have that chance, but she was not among the majority. Looking into the eyes of the stranger, proven as Ember Wane - formerly the commander of the Banner of the Covered Cage, Firethorn asked. "So, what brings you to such a secluded place?"\n\n"I have come to contribute to your cause, and even though this place may seem secluded, there are worse places in the Realm suffering in turmoil." Ember Wane replied. Firethorn frowned. "Those are pleasant words, but unlike the other generals and me, what were you doing at the most critical moment?""
  baccocc.15.a: "Ember Wane's face showed no sign of embarrassment."

  baccocc.16.t: "The Memorial"
  baccocc.16.d: ""Well, that's a valid point. But think about it, as 'Chief Commissioner', you must have thought how strangely foolish the Imperial Kirian Army's deployment was? Of course, it wouldn’t have been so easy if it weren't for those scumbags forming a makeshift army. And for me, I needed to familiarize myself with military tactics to forge that order." Firethorn began to recall a moment from her time leading the Peasant Army during the revolution. Thanks to an inexplicable shift in the IKA formation on that day, she and her soldiers could save their lives while surrounded and awaiting death.\n\n"Then why appear only now?" Firethorn asked, coming out of her thoughts.\n\n"Well, It was one thing to know that the NAKP was doing nothing but harm to the world, but it was another thing to know that a group of peasants opposing it had the will and capacity to stabilise the Realm. it was a different matter whether NAKP was a mere harm to the Realm or if the peasant mob opposing it had the will and capacity to stabilize the Realm. But my thoughts have changed recently. A few days ago, a preacher-provocateur came to the small village where I was hiding and pleaded for dedication to the cause. The starving and ragged figure was nothing but a tiny colt. Yet, what should an adult with will and capacity like myself fear, hiding in the outskirts?" Ember Wane replied. Firethorn reluctantly nodded in agreement.\n\n"Indeed, your existence has reassured me. Despite of you denying that vanished name, it still remains in the hearts of old ones like me. Even if you do not incorporate me into your 'committee', I will find and do what I can for the Realm. Today, I have come today only to see if you still possess the perspicaciousness you once had." Ember Wane turned and started walking away leisurely.\n\n"There is no need for doing so." Firethorn called out to his back. "Your dedication to this land is deserving of respect. You'll be able to wear clothes that fit again without having to figure out what you can do on your own. Of course, if you have taken an interest in military affairs, that would be welcome. However, this place is no longer the Realm. Only the Commonalty remains.""

  baccocc.36.d: "Kindling Flash watched as the metal monster chugged into Sorghum. The newly-built Sorghum Grand Central Terminus was packed with kirin of all trots of life, jammed so close together that the regiment of bannerkirin brought on for security struggled to keep the crowd from pushing them onto the glistening steel tracks in the station. Nokirin wanted to miss the exciting event, and he couldn't deny that he found it all exciting as well. After all, there would only ever be one first train from Verdant to Sorghum, reestablishing the link between the Realm's capital and its traditional gateway along the coast. This moment, mundane as it normally otherwise would have been, meant something fantastic for so many kirin, and for the prosperity of the Realm itself.\n\nWhen the train finally rolled into the station, everykirin present let out a cheer and stomped their hooves for the engineers at the controls. As the engineers were escorted out of the engine and feted with garlands, food, and rice wine, Kindling Flash serenely smiled out over the crowd. "With the completion of the Sorghum-Verdant Line, our Commonalty is once again a part of the outside world," he announced, to much hooting and hollering. "This marvel is the first fruit of what I sincerely hope will be a bountiful harvest between our Commonalty. Hoof in hoof, I pray to Her Radiant Trinity in all of Her glory that our two nations will have many more partnerships of mutual friendship and cooperation such as this one."\n\nThen, to the surprise and awe of the crowd assembled, Kindling Flash stepped forward with his comrades and boarded the train as engineers get in the train engine.

Even after the train reached its destination, she had to take a small boat along the famous river for quite a while longer. But it was worth it, for the reunion with her waiting family and lover.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Common Senate building in Sorghum, Ember Glow was engrossed in the paperwork that plagued her. From the day's major committee meeting minutes to new bills introduced to the Senate, and endless materials something else. It wasn't until her assistant interrupted her for the end of the workday that she remembered she had an important dinner engagement.\n\nIn a bustling restaurant that served both Hindian and Zaikirian cuisine, it was crowded with customers.

  #madkirin.1.d: "\"-Taking what is not one's own is called Theft (盜), and taking Life (生) and damaging Property (物) is called Robbery (賊).\"\n\nThe sun was high in the sky, and those rogues from NAKP, Divine Fire mystics, or mere bandits, were assembled in detention to listen to her lectures and be edified into true children of Concord.\n\n\"You, who roam day and night with sleeves rolled up and eyes glaring, shamelessly plunder, and the worst of you call money 'brother' and murder your own families to become generals, have no right to discuss ethics or morality. Moreover, you steal foods from locusts, clothes from silkworms, block bees and take their honey, and the cruelest of you pickle ant larvae by the name of Concord, what could be more brutal than you?\"\n\nThis time her gaze fell on Divine Fire mystics.\n\n\"You talk of Principle (理) and Nature (性), and frequently mention the Concord, but if we see it as the Celestial Call (召命), creatures and kirin are all part of the myriad of things. If we speak of the Benevolence (仁) with which Concord and creatures bring forth all things - equines, locusts, silkworms, bees, ants, and kirin are all nurtured by Concord and the earth; thus should not harm each other. Looking at the distinction between Good and Evil (善惡), openly plundering the homes of bees and ants would surely make one the Great Theft (巨盜) between Concord and creatures? And plundering the very foundation of locusts and silkworms, would that not make one the Arch-enemy (大賊) against Benevolent Morality (仁義) ?\"\n\nThen the rogues on the spot fell to their knees." #박지원, 호질(虎叱)
  #madkirin.1.c: "Her lecture is even more heretic."

 comm_WPU_1_desc: "Not everything that comes before the Senate is going to be the most important thing, but if some support for one of the less important things and getting away with a little political fluff could be exchanged with each other, it would sound like worth." #Senate에 올라오는 모든 안건이 가장 중요한 안건은 아닙니다. 하지만 그 덜 중요하다는 것들 중 하나에 대해 지지를 표한 후 가벼운 정치적 생색내기만으로 적당한 효과를 얻을 수 있다면 남는 장사겠죠.

 comm_COT_wuxia: "Supply Martial Art As A Sport For All"
 comm_COT_wuxia_desc: "Underdeveloped societies don't have much to enjoy, which means that as our country rapidly modernizes, there is a danger that we will become deeply indulged in the tastes and pleasures that come our way. Rather than leaving our traditional martial arts as the preserve of a few warrior monks, putting a little effort to make them available to everycreature would not only improve the health of the people, as opposed to those indulgences, but also foster a sense of solidarity by allowing us to share more in common with each other." # 저개발 사회에는 즐길거리가 많지 않습니다. 이는 우리나라가 급속히 현대화되는 과정에서 들어오는 기호품이나 향락 그 자체에 우리가 깊이 탐닉하게 될 위험이 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 우리 전통 무술을 소수 warrior monk들의 전유물로 남겨둘 것이 아니라 모두가 즐길 수 있도록 약간의 노력을 기울이면 저 향락들과는 반대로 인민의 건강을 증진시킬 수 있을뿐만 아니라 서로 더 많은 공통점을 공유하게 함으로써 연대의식 또한 기를 수 있습니다.

Its Matriarch-Commander, Firethorn was raised in a Banner that had both evolved into a complex clan and retained enough soldiers to fight alongside its equals (at least before the Silence).\n\nIn the Silence's last years, Firethorn had seen the folly of the Silence a century in the making. Her clan had propped themselves up thanks to their loyalty to the Realm, but outside the Banner's cosy home villages, the rest of Kiria had languished: just miles away, a small city had thrived; that seemed a lie when all she saw and walked through was a ghost town populated by farmers who lived hoof to mouth.\n\nThat memory returned when Rain Shine announced the Silence's end. No longer would her Banner and the soldiers she takes care of serve themselves and the decrepit pieces of a dying government. A reborn Realm she would serve: the Realm and all the kirin that are now suddenly free.\n\nBut the Second Cacophony did not leave any room for such a smooth destiny: she was forced to lose many of her bannerkirin - her kins - in the battle, and joined a hopeless peasant revolt to take revenge on the NAKP for causing the civil war. Only time would tell her final fate.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Tek"
